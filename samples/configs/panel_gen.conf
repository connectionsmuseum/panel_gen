# Switches of each type go here.
# max_dialing:	Maximum number of senders to occupy at once.
# normal_lines:	Number of lines to use in normal mode.
# heavy_lines:	Number of lines to use in high traffic mode.
# dahdi_group:	DAHDI group as assigned in Asterisk. 'r' signifies
# 		choose an originating line randomly, instead 
# 		of sequentially.
# demo_lines:   When "demo" mode is set by the API, this resets the
#               built-in safe defaults normally assumed.
# max_nxx:	Sets call weight to various offices.
# 		Is set per switch, since each has different trunking
# 		arrangements and capacity.
# line_range:	Range or list of terminating lines available on a
# 		switch. Panel always has a range. Crossbars have
# 		lists.
# gamma:	Low, Medium, and High traffic gammas. This is a 
# 		probability density used to pick the number of
# 		seconds to be on call or hung up before taking the
# 		next possible action. Always given as (k, Î¸).
