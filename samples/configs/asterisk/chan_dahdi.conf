; DAHDI Telephony Configuration file
;
; You need to restart Asterisk to re-configure the DAHDI channel
; CLI> module reload chan_dahdi.so
;      will reload the configuration file, but not all configuration options
;      are re-configured during a reload (signalling, as well as PRI and
;      SS7-related settings cannot be changed on a reload).
;
; This file documents many configuration variables.  Normally unless you know
; what a variable means or that it should be changed, there's no reason to
; un-comment those lines.
;
; Examples below that are commented out (those lines that begin with a ';' but
; no space afterwards) typically show a value that is not the default value,
; but would make sense under certain circumstances. The default values are
; usually sane. Thus you should typically not touch them unless you know what
; they mean or you know you should change them.

;
; Whether or not to enable call waiting on internal extensions
; With this set to 'yes', busy extensions will hear the call-waiting
; tone, and can use hook-flash to switch between callers. The Dial()
; app will not return the "BUSY" result for extensions.
;
callwaiting=yes
;
; Configure the number of outstanding call waiting calls for internal ISDN
; endpoints before bouncing the calls as busy.  This option is equivalent to
; the callwaiting option for analog ports.
; A call waiting call is a SETUP message with no B channel selected.
; The default is zero to disable call waiting for ISDN endpoints.
;max_call_waiting_calls=0
;
; Allow incoming ISDN call waiting calls.
; A call waiting call is a SETUP message with no B channel selected.
;allow_call_waiting_calls=no
;
; Configure the ISDN span to indicate MWI for the list of mailboxes.
; You can give a comma separated list of up to 8 mailboxes per span.
; An empty list disables MWI.
; The default is an empty list.
;mwi_mailboxes=mailbox_number[@context]{,mailbox_number[@context]}
;
; Whether or not restrict outgoing caller ID (will be sent as ANI only, not
; available for the user)
; Mostly use with FXS ports
; Does nothing.  Use hidecallerid instead.
;
;restrictcid=no
;
; Whether or not to use the caller ID presentation from the Asterisk channel
; for outgoing calls.
; See dialplan function CALLERID(pres) for more information.
; Only applies to PRI and SS7 channels.
;
usecallingpres=yes
;
; Some countries (UK) have ring tones with different ring tones (ring-ring),
; which means the caller ID needs to be set later on, and not just after
; the first ring, as per the default (1).
;
;sendcalleridafter = 2
;
;
; Support caller ID on Call Waiting
;
callwaitingcallerid=yes
;
; Support three-way calling
;
threewaycalling=yes
;
; For FXS ports (either direct analog or over T1/E1):
;   Support flash-hook call transfer (requires three way calling)
;   Also enables call parking (overrides the 'canpark' parameter)
;
; For digital ports using ISDN PRI protocols:
;   Support switch-side transfer (called 2BCT, RLT or other names)
;   This setting must be enabled on both ports involved, and the
;   'facilityenable' setting must also be enabled to allow sending
;   the transfer to the ISDN switch, since it sent in a FACILITY
;   message.
;   NOTE:  This should be disabled for NT PTMP mode.  Phones cannot
;   have tromboned calls pushed down to them.
;
transfer=yes
;
; Allow call parking
; ('canpark=no' is overridden by 'transfer=yes')
;
canpark=yes

; Sets the default parking lot for call parking.
; This is setable per channel.
; Parkinglots are configured in features.conf
;
;parkinglot=plaza

;
; Support call forward variable
;
cancallforward=yes
;
; Whether or not to support Call Return (*69, if your dialplan doesn't
; catch this first)
;
callreturn=yes
;
; Stutter dialtone support: If a mailbox is specified without a voicemail
; context, then when voicemail is received in a mailbox in the default
; voicemail context in voicemail.conf, taking the phone off hook will cause a
; stutter dialtone instead of a normal one.
;
; If a mailbox is specified *with* a voicemail context, the same will result
; if voicemail received in mailbox in the specified voicemail context.
;
; for default voicemail context, the example below is fine:
;
;mailbox=1234
;
; for any other voicemail context, the following will produce the stutter tone:
;
;mailbox=1234@context
;
; Enable echo cancellation
; Use either "yes", "no", or a power of two from 32 to 256 if you wish to
; actually set the number of taps of cancellation.
;
; Note that when setting the number of taps, the number 256 does not translate
; to 256 ms of echo cancellation.  echocancel=256 means 256 / 8 = 32 ms.
;
; Note that if any of your DAHDI cards have hardware echo cancellers,
; then this setting only turns them on and off; numeric settings will
; be treated as "yes". There are no special settings required for
; hardware echo cancellers; when present and enabled in their kernel
; modules, they take precedence over the software echo canceller compiled
; into DAHDI automatically.
;
;
echocancel=yes
;
; Some DAHDI echo cancellers (software and hardware) support adjustable
; parameters; these parameters can be supplied as additional options to
; the 'echocancel' setting. Note that Asterisk does not attempt to
; validate the parameters or their values, so if you supply an invalid
; parameter you will not know the specific reason it failed without
; checking the kernel message log for the error(s) put there by DAHDI.
;
;echocancel=128,param1=32,param2=0,param3=14
;
; Generally, it is not necessary (and in fact undesirable) to echo cancel when
; the circuit path is entirely TDM.  You may, however, change this behavior
; by enabling the echo canceller during pure TDM bridging below.
;
echocancelwhenbridged=yes
;
; In some cases, the echo canceller doesn't train quickly enough and there
; is echo at the beginning of the call.  Enabling echo training will cause
; DAHDI to briefly mute the channel, send an impulse, and use the impulse
; response to pre-train the echo canceller so it can start out with a much
; closer idea of the actual echo.  Value may be "yes", "no", or a number of
; milliseconds to delay before training (default = 400)
;
; WARNING:  In some cases this option can make echo worse!  If you are
; trying to debug an echo problem, it is worth checking to see if your echo
; is better with the option set to yes or no.  Use whatever setting gives
; the best results.
;
; Note that these parameters do not apply to hardware echo cancellers.
;
;echotraining=yes
;echotraining=800
;
; If you are having trouble with DTMF detection, you can relax the DTMF
; detection parameters.  Relaxing them may make the DTMF detector more likely
; to have "talkoff" where DTMF is detected when it shouldn't be.
;
;relaxdtmf=yes
;
; You may also set the default receive and transmit gains (in dB)
;
; Gain Settings: increasing / decreasing the volume level on a channel.
;                The values are in db (decibells). A positive number
;                increases the volume level on a channel, and a
;                negavive value decreases volume level.
;
; Dynamic Range Compression: you can also enable dynamic range compression
;                on a channel. This will amplify quiet sounds while leaving
;                louder sounds untouched. This is useful in situations where
;                a linear gain setting would cause clipping. Acceptable values
;                are in the range of 0.0 to around 6.0 with higher values
;                causing more compression to be done.
;
;                There are several independent gain settings:
;   rxgain: gain for the rx (receive - into Asterisk) channel. Default: 0.0
;   txgain: gain for the tx (transmit - out of Asterisk Asterisk) channel.
;           Default: 0.0
;   cid_rxgain: set the gain just for the caller ID sounds Asterisk
;               emits. Default: 5.0 .
;   rxdrc: dynamic range compression for the rx channel. Default: 0.0
;   txdrc: dynamic range compression for the tx channel. Default: 0.0

;rxgain=2.0
;txgain=3.0
;
;rxdrc=1.0
;txdrc=4.0
;
; Logical groups can be assigned to allow outgoing roll-over.  Groups range
; from 0 to 63, and multiple groups can be specified. By default the
; channel is not a member of any group.
;
; Note that an explicit empty value for 'group' is invalid, and will not
; override a previous non-empty one. The same applies to callgroup and
; pickupgroup as well.
;
group=1
;
; Ring groups (a.k.a. call groups) and pickup groups.  If a phone is ringing
; and it is a member of a group which is one of your pickup groups, then
; you can answer it by picking up and dialing *8#.  For simple offices, just
; make these both the same.  Groups range from 0 to 63.
